# MediBuddy-Chatbot
MediBuddy is a healthcare virtual assistant built using the Kore.ai conversational AI platform, designed to streamline patient interactions by enabling appointment management through natural language conversations.

The chatbot allows users to book, view, reschedule, and cancel doctor appointments by collecting key details such as patient name, doctor name, appointment date, and time through structured dialog flows. It also handles healthcare-related FAQs, providing quick responses to common patient queries such as document requirements, prescriptions, and visit guidelines.

The solution leverages intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialog orchestration to guide users through a smooth conversational experience with validation and error handling at each step. The bot is deployed on the Kore.ai Web/Mobile client, making it accessible for real-time testing.

To ensure reliability, batch testing was performed using CSV-based test cases covering booking, FAQ handling, appointment lookup, cancellation, and rescheduling scenarios.
